This is going to be a quick draft of my program

So, what is the idea?
Universal micro-credential verification app

So, we live in an era where credentials are pretty huge
Bachelors, Masters
Smaller ones are like full fledged professional licenses

But from the basics of blockchain, the specifics of a coding language, anything, micro
no need to make a full-fledged course
these can be decided by the individual
then these licenses can be built into bigger ones if one desires
AI powers personalized learning journeys
I was thinking how can this be "zettlekasten"ized but I'm not sure


Okay so the user logs into the platform, and is greeted with a home page which shows a place where they can pick right where they left off,
a popular things section, a new micro credentials section, a trending micro credentials section, and also for journeys the same treatment

There's 3 views: sysadmin, user, and creator
creator view: make tutorial, view and edit tutorial (enrollments, listing) and materials, they can also do user actions of learning for themselves
Maybe this idea is a little complex for my current need

you know what, I'll try continuing with this idea

There's a few elements here
1 - credential
5-30 minute tutorial on whateva
2 - Tutor
The person offering the tutorial
3 - Tutee
The person learning this stuff, for simplicity they can't be the tutor for now

But what if... to keep it open
We just had *The User*
Capable of being both a tutor AND a tutee, usually a tutee, but they can be both
Duolingo got the bite sized thing going on
Upwork got the peer to peer thing going on which I'm not sure about?

Anyways, Tutor Tutee Credential Platform sysadmin
alright, this is doable

Absolute MVP:
Tutor side:
A user can log in (), make a tutorial with its relevant material (title, description, multimedia/learning materials)
They can then see this course, edit its details, see its live statistics
They can perform actions on their tutorial (delete, archive, copy)

Tutee side:
A user can log in, see their homepage with relevant tutorials
They can enter a tutorial, see the materials
Mark it as complete, get the credential
See their credentials, export their credential/s 

Systemwide:
Users can make an account stored in the database which keeps track of all their data as tutors and tutees
